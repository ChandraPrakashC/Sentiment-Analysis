## Introduction

The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on airline-related tweets. The sentiment labels include "positive," "negative," and "neutral." We use machine learning models to classify the sentiment of each tweet.

## Data

We use a dataset containing tweets and their corresponding sentiment labels. The dataset is divided into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

The dataset has the following distribution:
- Negative: 8302 tweets
- Neutral: 2947 tweets
- Positive: 2260 tweets

## Preprocessing

In the preprocessing phase, we perform various text cleaning tasks, including:
- Removing Twitter handles
- Removing special characters and symbols
- Lemmatization
- Stopword removal

## Feature Extraction

We use the CountVectorizer to convert the text data into a bag-of-words representation, which is used as features for our machine learning model.

## Model Training

We train a logistic regression model with L2 regularization on the bag-of-words features. The model is trained to classify the tweets into one of the three sentiment categories.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix and a classification report. The results provide insights into the model's precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment category.

## Usage

To use the model for sentiment analysis, you can input a sentence or text, and the model will predict whether it falls into the "positive," "negative," or "neutral" sentiment category.

To make predictions, you can use the provided code for inference.

## Sample Predictions

You can make predictions using the trained model by providing text input. Here's an example of how to use the model for predictions:

```python
a = input("Enter the sentence: ")
a = lem(a)
a = removing_stopwords(a)
a = [a]
a = vectorizer.transform(a)
pred = svm_classifier.predict(a)
print(pred[0])
